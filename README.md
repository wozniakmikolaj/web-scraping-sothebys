# web-scraping-sothebys

## Goals and motivations
This repository is created to showcase my web scraping and data cleaning skills, by collecting data from RM Sotheby's - a dynamically generated car auction website using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The dataset will be used in a different project and quite possibly shared on kaggle for others to download and hone their skills on.

## Dataset
The datasets can be found in the [data]() folder in two versions raw(scraped from pages) and cleaned (clean version of the dataset). It contains data on RM Sotheby's car auctions between 2002 and 2019.

## Project structure
For the sake of readability the project is divided into three phases: 
1. Scraping couple of elements with detailed explaination. 
2. Automating the process of scraping all the data. 
3. Cleaning the scraped data.
